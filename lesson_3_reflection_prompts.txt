When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others, or doing development on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If more than one is working on the same repository we might get changes that is not ready to be pulled, and it might cause
	issues with what we are working on locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is when I'm working on different versions of the same repository locally.
	A Clone is when I either clone a repository I already have locally, or clone a repository on GitHub.
	A Fork is when I clone a repository directly on GitHub without involving the local computer as an intermediate step.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can look at the latest changes on the remote repository and even compare with what we have without having to merge the code in until we are ready.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Saving files and do manual compares etc.
	Most things would be a lot harder, especially to track changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
